missing 2048 size occur in the SSS M33USB mount, the possibility of baddump if FF is not continuous in the last 00 or sector view is high\n Please use there so that is a modified version\n Please use, such as PSPFILER / ISOTOOL / TEMPAR
missing 6144 size occur in the SSS, the possibility of baddump if data is not 00/FF  in the last line of sector view,it was corrupted\nUsing, for example, fixed mount USBMOUNT/ PSPFILER / ISOTOOL / TEMPAR / or manual completion
overdumped, would be normal if you trim it\nrecommended to run on the HDD / SSD / RAMDISK high-speed because it takes a lot on the Memory Stick
normal size
Size is normal, please check if there is corruption in the ISO9660 or viewer\n sector view (dummy discontinuity near-6k final decision) has to fill after the fill 0xFF 0x00
Size is normal, please check if there is corruption in the ISO9660 or viewer\n sector view (judged last-6k near corrupted data) may be a bad dump
Size is normal, check sector view and confirmed with a good image, but it is true, such as\n Valkyrie Profile (judged dummy last discontinuity near-2k) has to fill after the fill 0xFF 0x00
Size is normal, please check if there is corruption in the ISO9660 or viewer\n sector view (near-2k final judgment continuous data) may be a bad dump
